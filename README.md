# React Content Scroll

Provide a customizable scrollbar to your overflow content.

**WIP**, Still need a lot work to do.

Do not use it now. If you like to try it, here is how:

```bash
npm install
npm start && visite localhost:3000
```

## Server rendering

```js
var Rcs = require('react-content-scroll/lib/ssr');

React.renderToString(<Rcs />);
```
